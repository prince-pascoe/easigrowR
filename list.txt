1. Program Highlights
=====================


* **Sequence filtering** Performs sequence reordering,
   turning-point, dead-band, rise-fall filtering and rain-flow
   counting.  The filtered sequences may be written to a file.

* **Inbuilt data** Comes with a selection of beta factors,
   material data and crack growth models.

* **Calculated parameters** Calculates additional parameters for
   characterising the state of the crack tip so that better
   crack growth equations can be developed based on the most
   applicable parameters for a material.

* **Optimisation** Optimises the crack growth model parameters to
   minimise the difference between predicted and measured crack
   growth. The measured data need not be for the entire history
   i.e., one or more fractographic measurements of the width of
   a block.

* **Image generation** Generates a pseudo fractographic image of the fracture
   surface to see how easy it is to identify the individual
   blocks. 

2. Units
========

The internal da/dN data are all in units for stress intensity of (MPa
m^0.5) and growth in (m). Most beta equations use an applied far field
stress which is in units of (MPa). Thus the scaling factor in units of
(MPa) will generally convert the sequence into the correct
units. However, the compact-tension beta factor compact_tada73 uses
applied load not stress and is in units of load of (MN) and coupon
dimensions are in (m). The width and depth will need to be set for the
compact-tension beta function otherwise **easiGrow** will assume an
infinite plate and the crack will not grow.

5. Cycle Counting  Models
=========================

Crack growth is calculated for each cycle. The cyles can
be input directly or extracted from a sequence. The way the cycles are
determined affects the growth. The methods for extracting cycles from
a sequence are:

rainflow  Crack growth is calculated from rainflow cycles i.e. the
          stress intensity range comes from the range of the rainflow
          cycles. Note this has a slight re-ordering effect that may upset
          the order of any image plots created.

tension   Crack growth calculated from tension part of cycle i.e. from a valley
          to the next peak. The striation pattern follows these tension cycles.


6. da/dN data
=============

The da/dN model consists of EQUATION:material where the
equation variable specifies the name of the da/dN equation and is
one of  [nasgro, paris, forman, walker, burchill, hartman, white, file]
The material variable specifies the name of the parameters to use for
that equation. If the values are given in --parameters they will
be used instead of the standard library values.

7. File formats
===============

7.1. Crack file
---------------

The crack growth file is in the following format:

<line> <block> <a>
...

or 

<block> <a>
...

or

<a>
...
                   
Blank lines in the file indicate non-contiguous measurements. If
<line> or <block> are missing the program will assume the readings are
one block apart with each block measured at line 0. Use the same
format for the entire file. Where <line> represents the corresponding
line no. (starting at 0) of the sequence file, and <block> is the
no. of the block at that crack depth. Strictly speaking, the actual
block numbers are not used by easigrow with only the difference between
the block numbers in contiguous measurements used. Easigrow only
matches the average crack growth rate using:

   rate = log(growth between measurements) / log(no. of blocks between measurements).

7.2. Optimise file
------------------

Each line in the optimise file is a list of easigrow command lines
(without the 'easigrow' command) with each line containing the easigrow
options that will best reproduce the crack growth calculation for the
associated crack growth curve that it is trying to match. Note: Only
the material model specified by the main command line that invokes the
optimisation will be used for all crack predictions, since those will
be the parameters that are optimised. Any other material
specifications will be ignored.

The format of the optimisation file is:

<easigrow option> ... --crack <FILE1>
<easigrow option> ... --crack <FILE2>
...

7.3. Beta file
--------------

All lines beginning with a # are treated as a comment and ignored. The
format of the beta file is

# Comment describing the contents of the file
a/d beta 
...

7.4. Dadn file
--------------

All lines beginning with a # are treated as a comment and ignored. The
format of the file is:

# Comment describing the contents of the file
r1 r2 ....
dadn1 deltaK1_r1 deltaK1_r2 ....
dadn2 deltaK2_r1 deltaK2_r2 ....
...
